## Neppatsrev Coffee â€“ iOS App (SwiftUI)
This project was created to strengthen my understanding of SwiftUI, view composition, and navigation patterns in building mobile applications for the Apple ecosystem.

This is a simple proof-of-concept coffee shop app built using Swift, SwiftUI, and Xcode for iOS. The app simulates a basic customer experience at Neppatsrev Coffee, including drink customisation, store locator, and a loyalty card view.

### Features
- Multiple views with smooth navigation

- Drinks menu with 4 drink options

- Customisation options for each drink (e.g. size, milk, sweetness, toppings)

- Single reusable detail view for all drinks

- Store locator with 4 pinned store locations on map

- Loyalty card with:

  - Barcode image

  - User name

  - Coffee consumption counter (hardcoded)

- Clearly labeled screens with titles on every view

- Sketches and UI layout planned using SwiftUI components

### Tech Stack
- Swift

- SwiftUI

- Xcode
